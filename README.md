# Project Newton: an executive dysfunction/positivity helper
by Daneel Cayce

Newton is a helpful little robot friend for folks who struggle with executive dysfunction.

Right now, he's just a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/HelloNewtonBot) who reminds you to be kind to yourself. Eventually, you'll be able to take him along with you, so you can check in with yourself when you need to.
