# Project Newton: an executive dysfunction/positivity helper
by Daneel Adrian Cayce <<stratotron@gmail.com>>

Newton is a helpful little robot friend for folks who struggle with executive dysfunction.

Right now, he's just a [Mastodon bot](https://argon.city/@newton) who tweets self-care reminders every few hours. He was made with [Cheap Bots, Toot Sweet](https://cheapbotstootsweet.com). He's also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelloNewtonBot).

Eventually, you'll be able to take him along with you, so you can check in with yourself when you need to.
